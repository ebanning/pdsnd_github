### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This program is designed to be used by analysts in designing and marketing an urban bikeshare program. In this program, the user chooses to query bikeshare data from Chicago, New York City, or Washington to obtain statistics on the most common weekdays, hours, and stations used, as well as the total and average travel times. The user can choose to view all data for the given city or filter by month and/or day of the week. Statistics on user gender and year of birth are also available for Chicago and New York only. Finally, the user can view 5 lines data at a time if they want. The program then allows the user to continue viewing or filtering more data, or to quit.
